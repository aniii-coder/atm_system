<li>PIN Verification: Requires a correct PIN for all transactions.</li>
<li>Transaction History: Keeps a record of all transactions.</li>
<li>Total Calculations: Tracks total withdrawals and deposits.
</li><li>PIN Change: Allows users to change their PIN for security.</li>
<li>User-Friendly Interface: Provides a simple menu-driven interface for easy interaction.</li>
</ul>
Usage:-

<ul>
<li>Run the Code: Execute the Python script.</li>
<li>Enter PIN: You'll be prompted to enter your initial PIN.</li>
<li>Choose Options: Select the desired operation from the menu.</li>
<li>Follow Instructions: Follow the on-screen prompts to complete each transaction.</li>
</ul>
Customization
Initial PIN and Balance: Modify the pin and balance variables at the beginning of the code to set the initial values.
Error Handling: Enhance error handling for unexpected inputs or exceptions.
Additional Features: Consider adding features like interest calculations, account statements, or transaction limits.
